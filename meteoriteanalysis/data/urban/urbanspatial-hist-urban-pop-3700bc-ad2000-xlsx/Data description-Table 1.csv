The Historical Urban Population spreadsheet contains a time-series tabulation of population records from 3700 BC - AD 2000.,,,,
,,,,
Record: population record number in chronological order from 1-10352.,,,,
"City: spelling of primary city names matches the UN database of city names whenever possible. City names were matched to both the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects tables for settlements with populations over 300,000 inhabitants and the United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations tables (UN/LOCODE) using the name without diacritics column. Some ancient cities and historical archaeological sites do not have modern day equivalents. In such cases, original names from the Chandler and Modelski data sets were retained.",,,,
"OtherName: Chandler and Modelski also include alternate names for some cities. These names are included in the final data set in the ‘OtherName’ column. Additional alternate names and spellings, and location information such as state names for U.S. cities were added to this category/column. Alternate city names are separated with a comma.",,,,
Country: modern country names are identified according to the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects.,,,,
"Certainty: rank from 1-3 based on the accuracy of the city's geocoded match. Cities holding a rank of 1 are considered most accurate, while those of rank 3 are least accurate. Ranks were determined through consistency of results. If a city’s geolocation was confirmed by three geocoding sources, it was assigned an accuracy value of 1. Cities with matching results by two sources were assigned an accuracy value of 2, while cities that required numerous attempts to determine a potential geolocation and whose results were potentially more spurious were assigned a level 3 accuracy value. Less than 10% of the final data set for which no geolocation could be determined was discarded. In the data set report, an accuracy value of 1 was reported for 75% of the total cities, 2 for 13%, and 3 for 12%.",,,,
